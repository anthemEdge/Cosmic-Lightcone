# Cosmic-Lightcone

**Names(ID): Hognbo Tian(4180900) & Stephen Cripps(4184175)**

**Project Title: Cosmic Lightcone **

**Project Supervisor: Prof. Frazer Pearce **

##Project Description: 
We aim to construct virtual lightcones using snapshots from cosmological simulations. This will then enable the parameterisation of cosmic variance as a function of lightcone depth and opening angle for an observer in a comparable local density to that of our own. We can then make recommendation of the specifications required to reduce cosmic variance to an acceptable value for future surveys.

##Glossary:
Redshift tiling: Connecting one snapshot to the next in a lightcone to replicate light travel time.
Box wrapping: Periodic boundary conditions applied to the simulation box to artificially increase the volume of the simulation.
Time boundary: The boundary between a change in redshift (snapshot). 
Spatial boundary: The edge of the simulation box.
Time boundary crossing: A particle travels across a time boundary between snapshots, causing either replication or removal of the particle from the lightcone depending of the direction of travel.
Structure replication: The repeated observation of a structure after applying box wrapping.
